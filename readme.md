# ORGAN DONATION DECENTRALIZED APPLICATION

## Self Introduction
Hi! My name is Sindhu and I created this project because [Reason for creating the project].

## Project Description
The initiated system is an organ donation decentralized app using blockchain technology, which is a web application for patients to register their information like most medical ID, blood type, organ type and state.

The system would work on a first-in, first-out basis. Blockchain technology is used to secure the information of the organ donors and store them in a distributed database. 

Our system is a more secured approach, and it provides efficient automation than current approaches. 

It is much faster improving the scalability of the system.

 It is therefore impossible to falsify a block or add other false information without the approval of all authorized parties being involved

## Abstract
Organ donation being the most noble deed requires revolutionization. One cannot imagine the urgency and desperation a person feels when his/her family or friends are in need of such act and they could not locate an appropriate donor.

The Proposed System is a web-based Application which uses FIFO approach to select an organ donor for each genuine patient requiring a transplant and if there is an emergency case then the priority is given to that patient.

 It provides an efficient platform for potential organ doners and those who need the organs to connect. It uses Blockchain as its underlying Technology.

 Blockchain Technology uses digital documents which are digitally signed by the user so that they are timestamped at the time of saving the document and cannot be changed after that. It solves the issue of authenticating the same user again and again.
